## Using this template
### Editing the board
The file `flake.nix` contains two envars that are used to set the board to build for.

## Building the firmware
Run `cmake . -B ./build` from within the root and then `cmake --build ./build`.
Binaries will end up in the `./build/bin` folder.

Have fun <3
